<!-- {:title "New blog - elimai in action" :date "2013-10-05" :tags "elimai"} -->

If you haven't noticed already, this blog has been generated with [elimai][elimai] - a minimalistic static site generator written in Clojure. The idea is similar to jekyll, except the core goal is to make it as minimal and simple as possible, hence the name `elimai` which means simplicity in Tamil.

It won't be having all the advanced features that other static site generators provide, but if needed it should be easy enough to customize everything including the core, which is less than 100 LOC.

Currently, the following features are in pipeline:

* Support for adding pages
* Creating new posts from command-line 
* Archives
* Search
